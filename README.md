# Millionaire-game
Brief: 				

Me and my 2 friends have made our own version of the popular game show “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire”. We created a VB Form as we wanted the user to use a GUI (Graphical User Interface). We thought it would be most appropriate as the game show is quite interactive.  The way it should be played by the user reading the question then clicking (with a mouse) on the correct answer and progressing through the questions. If the user gets a question wrong, then they will have to click the retry button when prompted with a message box, the application automatically restarts. The way how different players may play the game is by playing as a group, alone, playing against friends to see who is quickest at answering all questions.  The only way to input answers is by clicking on a possible answer not by typing in Yes or no for example. 

The fact that the game show is in the format of multiple-choice, allows us to implement features, like IF STATEMENTS, FOR LOOPS, VARIABLES ETC. In terms of the questions given to the user, there are 3 different topics (BGS, Jobs and Further Education) with 5 questions each. Every correct answer doubles the amount of money the user has at that time. As the target audience is our peers, something educational would benefit them and be more appropriate. 

Success Criteria:			

We wanted to have certain parameters to ensure our program meets the expected requirements:


Have a money/points system in place

→Every time the user gets a question correct, their money will double. The money is a changing variable. The way we can measure this is by seeing if a user can get to £1,000,000.
Different ranges of questions

→This is to avoid the user getting bored, but also make the experience more challenging.
Visual and aesthetic UI
→Essential as it would be a  front end. Would set us apart from the groups making a text-based quiz show. It makes the consumer’s experience better and ensures us that our program is intuitive yet also visually appealing. The background of the front end has to be the conventional style of the real game show.
Have the program reset after a wrong answer
→Another key element because if we were to closely match the real “Who Wants to be a Millionaire” then we wouldn’t let them continue the game after a wrong answer. Instead of lifelines, they are able to get a question wrong, receive a pop-up message and click retry to have another go.



 Efficient code 
 
→Ideal situation because it allows us to test VB to its limit and assess whether Vb is the best language to write efficient code that allows for a front end. 
The User needs to reach £1,000,000
→This is the whole idea of the popular game show and if we wanted to emulate the board game then we should have the user able to win £1,000,000
Allow for the program to receive user input (from the front end).

→Probably the most important thing for any program. This game show we have made is dependent on the user entering a question; when the user enters an answer the program acts accordingly (whether to restart the program, give points, change question etc).
The program includes all 15 questions with correct answers
→This is expected because without the correct questions with the appropriate questions the game would be a guessing game.
15 questions in total (5 for every topic) in the format of multiple
→A variety of questions is needed to make the program feel like a game show. Multiple choices for each question allows the user to no guess but also still have a chance of getting it correct. Multiple choices are also needed to make the game a little bit easier and also feel like the real game show
Clearly shows instructions to the user
→In order for this to happen, we would have a message box that pops ups every time the user runs the program. Instructions need to be short and concise to not confuse the user.
